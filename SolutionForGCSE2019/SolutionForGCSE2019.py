'''
Herein lay the solutions I have come up with for the 2019 Spec GCSE coding challenges
THESE ARE MINE
I WILL fail anyone who copies and pastes my code, it is for learning ONLY
If you need help, ask me, Google or your buddy - DO NOT COPY IT.
You will note that each solution has the SPEC right in there to help you see what is left to do
THIS is what comments are for, use them (It also shows me you understand what your code is 
doing)

NOTE
The login file for all the games is SHARED
